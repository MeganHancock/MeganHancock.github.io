I began my professional life as a cosmetologist, joining a talented team at one of the top salons in Boise, Idaho. After over five years learning from best, I decided it was time to open my own single chair salon, where the focus was cruelty-free products, and a quiet, tranquil environment. This allowed me space to put a focus around giving back to the community as well, and I launched Unhoused Haircuts, and initiate where I visited local homeless shelters and economically disadvantaged resource center and offer haircuts to the patrons in need. Only after an infamous worldwide societal hiatus in 2020 did I decide it was time to search for my next passion. My quest took me to the mountains to work in a machine shop making knives, to a big city to manage a bakery, and back to my hometown to be a legal assistant. Nothing quite satisfied my need for growth and learning, until I decided to dive into the software development industry. I immediately felt at home exploring an industry that no matter how hard you try, there will always be more to learn. I was hooked! <br data-v-cfb33409><br data-v-cfb33409> After completing freeCodeCamp&#39;s 300 hour course for Responsive Web Design, I was eager for more, and I became a enrolled at CodeWorks software development boot camp. This was no easy feat, as I was living a very comfortable life as a legal assistant, but one has to do what one has to do! I dedicated my mornings and evenings to teaching myself software development, and weekend to working a part time job to be able to afford school sooner. I saved for months, moved in with roommates, and quit my job to become a full time student.<br data-v-cfb33409><br data-v-cfb33409> Now, after over 500 hours of instruction and building over 20 applications, I am nearing the end of the CodeWorks 13-week intensive boot camp. In addition to expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I&#39;ve learned to work with C#, SQL, Node.js, MongoDB, Vue.js, Git, GitHub, Express.js, and more. I&#39;ve also gained invaluable experience working in agile environments, collaborating on seven different applications alongside other talented developers. I have learned so much and will forever be grateful for this experience. <br data-v-cfb33409><br data-v-cfb33409> I have developed a profound appreciation for working with back-end technologies and languages, and I&#39;ve found that I particularly enjoy C#, but ultimately the only thing I am seeking in a career is joining a team of developers that is as excited about my growth as I am. </p></div></section><section class="row" data-v-cfb33409><div class="col-12" data-v-cfb33409><p class="sub-text" data-v-cfb33409>let&#39;s stay in touch!</p><br data-v-cfb33409><p class="title-text text-center d-none d-md-block" data-v-cfb33409>MeganHancockDev@gmail.com</p></div></section>',2),l=[d];function c(r,f,b,v,m,u){return t(),o("div",s,l)}const g=e(n,[["render",c],["__scopeId","data-v-cfb33409"]]);export{g as default};
